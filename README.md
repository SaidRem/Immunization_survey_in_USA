# Immunization_survey_in_USA
The research based on "National Immunization Survey-Child"
presented by National Center for Immuniztion and Respiratory Diseases.

The NIS-Child uses two phases of data collection to obtain vaccination information for a large national probability sample of young children:
an RDD telephone survey designed to identify households with children 19
through 35 months of age, followed by the Provider Record Check, a mailed
survey to children's vaccination providers. This section summarizes these
two phases of data collection. Other descriptions of the sample design are given by Ezzati-Rice et al. (1995), Zell et al. (2000), Smith et al. 
(2001a, 2005), and Wolter et al. (2017a).
